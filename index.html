      <h1>What I like</h1>
      I'm mostly interested in research, mainly on topics related to type
      systems, functional programming, static verification and program
      semantics. I'm particularly interested in the applications of modal
      logic to type theory.

      I'm also interested in philosophy, mostly epistemology and ethics,
      although my expertise in these fields is nearly non-existent.
