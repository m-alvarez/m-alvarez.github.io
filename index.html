      <h1>Who I am</h1>
      <p>
        My name's Mario Alvarez-Picallo, I'm a MSc student currently enrolled
        in the second year of the 
        <a href="https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/">MPRI</a> program. I
        do computery stuff, hence the github account. You'll probably notice
        that it's quite empty, but I expect to start filling it as soon as I
        start having time for pet projects.

      <h1>What I know</h1>
      <p>
        I graduated from the Universidad Autonoma de Madrid in 2014, attaining
        the equivalent of First-class Honours degrees in both general
        mathematics and computer science. This means that, among other things,
        I have a working knowledge of programming, operating systems, machine
        learning, artificial intelligence and so forth.
      </p>

      <p>
        My experience in the MPRI has also given me some knowledge of type
        systems, abstract interpretation, linear logic, category theory and
        similar theoretical fields.

      <h1>What I like</h1>
      <p>
        I'm mostly interested in research, mainly on topics related to type
        systems, functional programming, static verification and program
        semantics. I'm particularly interested in the applications of modal
        logic to type theory.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm also interested in philosophy, mostly epistemology and ethics,
        although my expertise in these fields is nearly non-existent.
